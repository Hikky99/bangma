I developed this disease prediction model to accurately predict various diseases based on medical records. This project holds significant importance as disease prediction algorithms play a vital role in healthcare, aiding in early diagnosis, timely interventions, and improved patient outcomes.

Dataset
I utilized a royalty free Kaggle dataset consisting of medical records with labeled diseases as the target variable. To handle data manipulation and model development, I used python Scikit-learn library and pandas for seamless data manipulation.

Data Preprocessing
To ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset, I performed data preprocessing steps. This involved cleaning the data by removing duplicates and irrelevant records. Additionally, I transformed categorical variables using appropriate methods, such as one-hot encoding, to represent them numerically. Lastly, I split the dataset into training and testing sets for effective model evaluation.

Model Development
To achieve accurate disease predictions, I carefully selected the Decision Tree Classifier algorithm. The Decision Tree Classifier is renowned for its ability to capture complex relationships within the data. I trained the model using the training data, enabling it to learn patterns and make accurate disease predictions.

Prediction and Analysis
Using the trained Decision Tree Classifier model, I made predictions on unseen test data. By applying the model's predict function, I obtained disease predictions for each record. To provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, I created a comparison table that juxtaposed the predicted diseases with the actual disease labels. This analysis confirmed the high accuracy of the predictions, as both the training and testing accuracies achieved a remarkable 100% score. Precision, recall and f1-score were also 100%.

Styling and Presentation
To enhance the visual appeal and the prediction results, I employed  styling techniques. I formatted and styled the prediction results table to achieve a dark, elegant, and futuristic design. The styling choices emphasized readability and professionalism, ensuring the results were presented in a visually pleasing manner.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this disease prediction model represents a significant achievement in the field of healthcare. By harnessing the power of the Decision Tree Classifier algorithm, I successfully developed a robust and accurate model capable of predicting various diseases. The project's outcomes, including the high training and testing accuracies of 100%, demonstrate the model's effectiveness in early disease detection. This project holds immense value in healthcare applications, as accurate disease predictions empower healthcare professionals to provide timely interventions, resulting in improved patient outcomes.
